# Product Guidelines: Tiny Invoicing

## Tone and Voice
The tone and voice for all product documentation and user-facing messages will be **Direct and Concise**. This approach prioritizes brevity and efficiency, delivering information clearly and without unnecessary embellishment. This is particularly suitable for a utility-focused application like an invoicing system, where users require quick access to essential information and functionalities.
